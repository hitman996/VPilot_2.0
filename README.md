# VPilot
Scripts and tools to easily communicate with [DeeperGTAV](https://github.com/gdpinchina/DeeperGTAV).

## How it works

VPilot uses JSON over TCP sockets to start, configure and send/receive commands to/from [DeeperGTAV](https://github.com/gdpinchina/DeeperGTAV) by using the Python DeepGTAV libraries. 

_dataset_ and _drive_ serve as examples to collect a dataset using DeepGTAV and giving the control to an agent respectively. Minimum requirement: Python 3.2 or greater
